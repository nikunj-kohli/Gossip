## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI

### Frontend (Planned)

## System Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: API endpoints and WebSocket connections
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Controllers and services
3. **Data Access Layer**: Models and database interactions
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Cross-cutting concerns like logging, caching, security

### Key Design Principles
- RESTful API design
- Service-oriented architecture
- Repository pattern for data access
- Circuit breakers for resilience
- Rate limiting for API protection
- Comprehensive error handling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- PostgreSQL (v12+)
- Redis (v6+)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash

- Endpoint specifications
- Request/response formats
- Authentication requirements
- Example requests

## Security Features

- JWT-based authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- Circuit breakers for dependent services

## Resilience & Performance

- Redis caching for performance
- Memory fallbacks for service failures
- Database query monitoring
- Batch processing for high-volume operations
- Comprehensive logging
- Health check endpoints

## Testing

The project includes:

- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Edge case tests for validation
- Load testing configurations
- Security testing tooling
